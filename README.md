# No Releasing Tropical Fish

[中文](./README-zh-tw.md)

My friends know that I am writing Minecraft mod.
They don't really cherish food wasted on baby animals,
but they noticed a problem that is not covered by my previous mod.

That is: when breeding axolotls, players often release tropical fishes accidently.

So, I decide to write this mod for them.
